# Prediction-model 💹


## Description 😉: 
Based on the dataset given the following code uses **Linear Regression** machine learning algorithm which predict's the **Score** a student will get depending on the number of **Hours** he/she studies.

## Getting Started 😍 : 
To run this project the following steps have to be followed : 
- Clone the repository using , git clone [**https://github.com/SamayMody/Prediction-model**](https://github.com/SamayMody/Prediction-model)
- Navigate to my project directory : cd /content
-  Install dependencies : **pip install -r requirements.txt**
## Prerequisites 🤓 :
- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib


## Code explanation 🫡 : 
1. In the first section of the code **(Performing EDA)** I have performed basic **Exploratory Data Analysis** **(EDA)** to study more about the dataset and find the best machine learning algorithm!
2. In the next section **(Building the Model)** we begin to build the Machine learning model.
3. In the third section **(Implementation)** we can use the model to find out the scores based on hours studied. For example in the code we have entered **9.25** as the hours studied and the predicted score to that is **93.6**.
 ### Data Split 🧐 : 
 - Training = 20%
 - Testing = 80%
